Math,6,669,"At Level 6, students can conceptualise, generalise and utilise information based on their investigations and modelling of complex problem situations, and can use their knowledge in relatively non-standard contexts. They can link different information sources and representations and flexibly translate among them. Students at this level are capable of advanced mathematical thinking and reasoning. These students can apply this insight and understanding, along with a mastery of symbolic and formal mathematical operations and relationships, to develop new approaches and strategies for attacking novel situations. Students at this level can reflect on their actions, and can formulate and precisely communicate their actions and reflections regarding their findings, interpretations, arguments, and the appropriateness of these to the original situation.",
Math,5,607,"At Level 5 students can develop and work with models for complex situations, identifying constraints and specifying assumptions. They can select, compare, and evaluate appropriate problem-solving strategies for dealing with complex problems related to these models. Students at this level can work strategically using broad, well-developed thinking and reasoning skills, appropriate linked representations, symbolic and formal characterisations, and insight pertaining to these situations. They begin to reflect on their work and can formulate and communicate their interpretations and reasoning",
Math,4,545,"At Level 4 students can work effectively with explicit models for complex concrete situations that may involve constraints or call for making assumptions. They can select and integrate different representations, including symbolic, linking them directly to aspects of real-world situations. Students at this level can utilise their limited range of skills and can reason with some insight, in straightforward contexts. They can construct and communicate explanations and arguments based on their interpretations, arguments, and actions.",
Math,3,482,"At Level 3 students can execute clearly described procedures, including those that require sequential decisions. Their interpretations are sufficiently sound to be a base for building a simple model or for selecting and applying simple problem-solving strategies. Students at this level can interpret and use representations based on different information sources and reason directly from them. They typically show some ability to handle percentages, fractions and decimal numbers, and to work with proportional relationships. Their solutions reflect that they have engaged in basic interpretation and reasoning.",
Math,2,420,"At Level 2 students can interpret and recognise situations in contexts that require no more than direct inference. They can extract relevant information from a single source and make use of a single representational mode. Students at this level can employ basic algorithms, formulae, procedures, or conventions to solve problems involving whole numbers. They are capable of making literal interpretations of the results.",
Math,1,358,At Level 1 students can answer questions involving familiar contexts where all relevant information is present and the questions are clearly defined. They are able to identify information and to carry out routine procedures according to direct instructions in explicit situations. They can perform actions that are almost always obvious and follow immediately from the given stimuli.,
Reading,6,698,"Tasks  at  this  level  typically  require  the  reader  to  make  multiple  inferences,  comparisons  and  contrasts  that  are  both  detailed  and  precise.  They  require  demonstration  of  a  full  and  detailed  understanding of one or more texts and may involve integrating information from more than one text.  Tasks  may  require  the  reader  to  deal  with  unfamiliar  ideas,  in  the  presence  of  prominent  competing information, and to generate abstract categories for interpretations. Reflect and evaluate tasks  may  require  the  reader  to  hypothesise  about  or  critically  evaluate  a  complex  text  on  an  unfamiliar topic, taking into account multiple criteria or perspectives, and applying sophisticated understandings from beyond the text. A salient condition for access and retrieve tasks at this level is precision of analysis and fine attention to detail that is inconspicuous in the texts.",
Reading,5,626,"Tasks  at  this  level  that  involve  retrieving  information  require  the  reader  to  locate  and  organise  several pieces of deeply embedded information, inferring which information in the text is relevant. Reflective  tasks  require  critical  evaluation  or  hypothesis,  drawing  on  specialised  knowledge.  Both interpretative and reflective tasks require a full and detailed understanding of a text whose content or form is unfamiliar. For all aspects of reading, tasks at this level typically involve dealing with concepts that are contrary to expectations.",
Reading,4,553,Tasks  at  this  level  that  involve  retrieving  information  require  the  reader  to  locate  and  organise  several pieces of embedded information. Some tasks at this level require interpreting the meaning of  nuances  of  language  in  a  section  of  text  by  taking  into  account  the  text  as  a  whole.  Other  interpretative  tasks  require  understanding  and  applying  categories  in  an  unfamiliar  context.  Reflective  tasks  at  this  level  require  readers  to  use  formal  or  public  knowledge  to  hypothesise  about or critically evaluate a text. Readers must demonstrate an accurate understanding of long or complex texts whose content or form may be unfamiliar.,
Reading,3,480,"Tasks  at  this  level  require  the  reader  to  locate,  and  in  some  cases  recognise  the  relationship  between, several pieces of information that must meet multiple conditions. Interpretative tasks at this level require the reader to integrate several parts of a text in order to identify a main idea, understand a relationship or construe the meaning of a word or phrase. They need to take into account many features in comparing, contrasting or categorising. Often the required information is not prominent or there is much competing information; or there are other text obstacles, such as ideas that are contrary to expectation or negatively worded. Reflective tasks at this level may require connections, comparisons, and explanations, or they may require the reader to evaluate a feature of the text. Some reflective tasks require readers to demonstrate a fine understanding of the text in relation to familiar, everyday knowledge. Other tasks do not require detailed text comprehension but require the reader to draw on less common knowledge. ",
Reading,2,407,"Some tasks at this level require the reader to locate one or more pieces of information, which may need to be inferred and may need to meet several conditions. Others require recognising the main idea in a text, understanding relationships, or construing meaning within a limited part of the text when the information is not prominent and the reader must make low level inferences. Tasks at this level may involve comparisons or contrasts based on a single feature in the text. Typical reflective tasks at this level require readers to make a comparison or several connections between the text and outside knowledge, by drawing on personal experience and attitudes",
Reading,1,335,"Tasks  at  this  level  require  the  reader  to  locate  one  or  more  independent  pieces  of  explicitly  stated information; to recognise the main theme or author’s purpose in a text about a familiar topic, or to make a simple connection between information in the text and common, everyday knowledge. Typically the required information in the text is prominent and there is little, if any, competing information. The reader is explicitly directed to consider relevant factors in the task and in the text.",
Reading,0,262,"Tasks at this level require the reader to locate a single piece of explicitly stated information in a prominent position in a short, syntactically simple text with a familiar context and text type, such as a narrative or a simple list. The text typically provides support to the reader, such as repetition of  information,  pictures  or  familiar  symbols.  There  is  minimal  competing  information.  In  tasks  requiring  interpretation  the  reader  may  need  to  make  simple  connections  between  adjacent  pieces of information. ",
DigitalReading,5,626,"Tasks at this level typically require the reader to locate, analyse and critically evaluate  information,  related  to  an  unfamiliar  context,  in  the  presence  of  ambiguity. They require the generation of criteria to evaluate the text. Tasks may require navigation across multiple sites without explicit direction and detailed interrogation of texts in a variety of formats.",
DigitalReading,4,553,"Tasks at this level may require the reader to evaluate information from several sources, navigating across several sites comprising texts in a variety of formats, and  generating  criteria  for  evaluation  in  relation  to  a  familiar,  personal  or  practical  context.  Other  tasks  at  this  level  demand  that  the  reader  construe  complex  information  according  to  well-defined  criteria  in  a  scientific  or  technical context",
DigitalReading,3,480,"Tasks  at  this  level  require  that  the  reader  integrate  information,  either  by  navigating  across  several  sites  to  find  well-defined  target  information,  or  by  generating  simple  categories  when  the  task  is  not  explicitly  stated.  Where  evaluation is called for, only the information that is most directly accessible or only part of the available information is required.",
DigitalReading,2,407,"Tasks  at  this  level  typically  require  the  reader  to  locate  and  interpret  information  that  is  well-defined,  usually  relating  to  familiar  contexts.  They  may require navigation across a limited number of sites and the application of  web-based  tools  such  as  dropdown  menus,  where  explicit  directions  are  provided  or  only  low-level  inference  is  called  for.  Tasks  may  require  integrating information presented in different formats, recognising examples that fit clearly defined categories",
Science,6,708,"At  Level  6,  students  can  consistently  identify,  explain  and  apply  scientific knowledge  and knowledge  about  science  in  a  variety  of  complex  life situations.  They  can  link  different  information  sources  and  explanations and use evidence from those sources to justify decisions. They clearly and consistently  demonstrate  advanced  scientific  thinking  and  reasoning,  and they demonstrate willingness to use their scientific understanding in support of solutions to unfamiliar scientific and technological situations. Students at this level can use scientific knowledge and develop arguments in support of recommendations and decisions that centre on personal, social or global situations. ",
Science,5,633,"At  Level  5,  students  can  identify  the  scientific  components  of  many complex  life  situations,  apply  both  scientific  concepts  and knowledge about  science  to  these  situations,  and  can  compare,  select  and  evaluate appropriate scientific evidence for responding to life situations. Students at  this  level  can  use  well-developed  inquiry  abilities,  link  knowledge appropriately and bring critical insights to situations. They can construct explanations  based  on  evidence  and  arguments  based  on  their  critical analysis.",
Science,4,559,"At Level 4, students can work effectively with situations and issues that may involve explicit phenomena requiring them to make inferences about the role of  science  or  technology. They  can  select  and  integrate  explanations  from different  disciplines  of  science  or  technology  and  link  those  explanations directly to aspects of life situations. Students at this level can reflect on their actions and they can communicate decisions using scientific knowledge and evidence.",
Science,3,484,"At Level 3, students can identify clearly described scientific issues in a range of contexts. They can select facts and knowledge to explain phenomena and  apply  simple  models  or  inquiry  strategies.  Students  at  this  level  can interpret  and  use  scientific  concepts  from  different  disciplines  and  can apply  them  directly. They  can  develop  short  statements  using  facts  and make decisions based on scientific knowledge.","
"
Science,2,410,"At  Level  2,  students  have  adequate  scientific  knowledge  to  provide possible explanations in familiar contexts or draw conclusions based on simple  investigations. They  are  capable  of  direct  reasoning  and  making literal  interpretations  of  the  results  of  scientific  inquiry  or  technological problem solving.",
Science,1,335,"At Level 1, students have such a limited scientific knowledge that it can only  be  applied  to  a  few,  familiar  situations. They  can  present  scientific explanations  that  are  obvious  and  that  follow  explicitly  from  given evidence. ",
ProblemSolving,6,683,"At Level 6, students can develop complete, coherent mental models of diverse problem scenarios, enabling them to solve complex problems efficiently. They can explore a scenario in a highly strategic manner to understand all information pertaining to the problem. The information may be presented in different formats, requiring interpretation and integration of related parts. When confronted with very complex devices, such as home appliances that work in an unusual or unexpected manner, they quickly learn how to control the devices to achieve a goal in an optimal way. Level 6 problem-solvers can set up general hypotheses about a system and thoroughly test them. They can follow a premise through to a logical conclusion or recognise when there is not enough information available to reach one. In order to reach a solution, these highly proficient problem-solvers can create complex, flexible, multi-step plans that they continually monitor during execution. Where necessary, they modify their strategies, taking all constraints into account, both explicit and implicit.",
ProblemSolving,5,618,"At Level 5, students can systematically explore a complex problem scenario to gain an understanding of how relevant information is structured. When faced with unfamiliar, moderately complex devices, such as vending machines or home appliances, they respond quickly to feedback in order to control the device. In order to reach a solution, Level 5 problem-solvers think ahead to find the best strategy that addresses all the given constraints. They can immediately adjust their plans or backtrack when they detect unexpected difficulties or when they make mistakes that take them off course.",
ProblemSolving,4,553,"At Level 4, students can explore a moderately complex problem scenario in a focused way. They grasp the links among the components of the scenario that are required to solve the problem. They can control moderately complex digital devices, such as unfamiliar vending machines or home appliances, but they don’t always do so efficiently. These students can plan a few steps ahead and monitor the progress of their plans. They are usually able to adjust these plans or reformulate a goal in light of feedback. They can systematically try out different possibilities and check whether multiple conditions have been satisfied. They can form an hypothesis about why a system is malfunctioning, and describe how to test it.",
ProblemSolving,3,488,"At Level 3, students can handle information presented in several different formats. They can explore a problem scenario and infer simple relationships among its components. They can control simple digital devices, but have trouble with more complex devices. Problem-solvers at Level 3 can fully deal with one condition, for example, by generating several solutions and checking to see whether these satisfy the condition. When there are multiple conditions or inter-related features, they can hold one variable constant to see the effect of change on the other variables. They can devise and execute tests to confirm or refute a given hypothesis. They understand the need to plan ahead and monitor progress, and are able to try a different option if necessary.",
ProblemSolving,2,423,"At Level 2, students can explore an unfamiliar problem scenario and understand a small part of it. They try, but only partially succeed, to understand and control digital devices with unfamiliar controls, such as home appliances and vending machines. Level 2 problem-solvers can test a simple hypothesis that is given to them and can solve a problem that has a single, specific constraint. They can plan and carry out one step at a time to achieve a sub-goal, and have some capacity to monitor overall progress towards a solution.",
ProblemSolving,1,358,"At Level 1, students can explore a problem scenario only in a limited way, but tend to do so only when they have encountered very similar situations before. Based on their observations of familiar scenarios, these students are able only to partially describe the behaviour of a simple, everyday device. In general, students at Level 1 can solve straightforward problems provided there is only a simple condition to be satisfied and there are only one or two steps to be performed to reach the goal. Level 1 students tend not to be able to plan ahead or set sub-goals.",
Financial,5,625,"Students apply their understanding of a wide range of financial terms and concepts to contexts that may only become relevant to their lives in the long term. They analyse complex financial products. They take into account features of financial documents that are significant but unstated or not immediately evident, such as transaction costs. They work with a high level of accuracy and solve non-routine financial problems. They describe the potential outcomes of financial decisions, showing an understanding of the wider financial landscape, such as income tax.",
Financial,4,550,"Students apply their understanding of less common financial concepts and terms to contexts that will be relevant to them as they move towards adulthood, such as bank account management and compound interest in saving products. They interpret and evaluate a range of detailed financial documents such as bank statements, and explain the functions of less commonly used financial products. They make financial decisions taking into account longer-term consequences such as the impact of loan repayment on cost. They solve routine problems in less common financial contexts.",
Financial,3,475,"Students apply their understanding of commonly used financial concepts, terms and products to situations that are relevant to them. They begin to consider the consequences of financial decisions and they make simple financial plans in familiar contexts. They make straightforward interpretations of a range of financial documents. They apply a range of basic numerical operations, including calculating percentages. They choose the numerical operations needed to solve routine problems in relatively common financial literacy contexts, such as budget calculations.",
Financial,2,400,"Students begin to apply their knowledge of common financial products and commonly used financial terms and concepts. They use given information to make financial decisions in contexts that are immediately relevant to them. They recognise the value of a simple budget. They interpret prominent features of everyday financial documents. They apply single basic numerical operations, including division, to answer financial questions. They show an understanding of the relationships between different financial elements, such as the amount of use and the costs incurred.",
Financial,1,326,"Students identify common financial products and terms, and interpret information relating to basic financial concepts. They recognise the difference between needs and wants and they make simple decisions on everyday spending. They recognise the purpose of everyday financial documents and apply single and basic numerical operations (addition, subtraction or multiplication) in financial contexts that they are likely to have experienced personally.",
